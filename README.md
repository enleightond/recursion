# recursion

Write both an iterative and recursive solution to each problem:

Define a recursive function that takes an argument n and prints the lyrics to 99 bottles of beer on the wall, starting with that number n
Define a recursive function that takes an argument n and returns the fibonacci value of that position. The fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... So fib(5) should return 5 and fib(6) should return 8.
Define a recursive function that returns true if a string is a palindrome and false otherwise.
